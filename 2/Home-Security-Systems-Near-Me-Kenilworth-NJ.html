Hello Rebeca, thanks for this blog. I am so thankful that you have actually discussed about wise home integration Simply last week I was provided bunch of cameras to install by a homeowner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems.

<p>Wireless home security is versatile. Move it if you do not like where a sensor or camera is put. There are no wires stopping you. Include them or take them away quickly if you desire more or less gadgets on your system. You can install the system yourself or employ a professional. The choice is yours. Wired systems require expert installation, and you can't quickly include equipment or move it around. You're tethered by wires. Wireless systems provide a flexibility that wired systems can not.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that shops it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we may review this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video footage to the cloud.

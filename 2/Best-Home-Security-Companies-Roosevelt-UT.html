To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom.

<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems use easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies provide (and in some cases require) professional installation. Professional installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, implying you will not have the ability to connect it directly to other third-party gadgets like wise locks or automate specific actions in the home.

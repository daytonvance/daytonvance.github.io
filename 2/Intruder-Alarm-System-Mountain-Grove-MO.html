<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

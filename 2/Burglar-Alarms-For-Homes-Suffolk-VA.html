<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which suggests you can use a number of different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant devices. Our company believe alarm systems work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control.

DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brand names we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, use both professional and self-monitoring.

<p>Another way to keep recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR).

Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years, go with the contract and reap those savings. However if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>

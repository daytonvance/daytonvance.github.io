We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being seen know they're being viewed, and you can choose to record video clips or photos and conserve them to your smart gadget on a whim.</p>

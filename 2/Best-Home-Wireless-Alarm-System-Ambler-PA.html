<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.

However, this is usually a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend on how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, expandability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike homeowners, usually prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various homes later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and basic home automation.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>

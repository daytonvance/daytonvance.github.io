<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

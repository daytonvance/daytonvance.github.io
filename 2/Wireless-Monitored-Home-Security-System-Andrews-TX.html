<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life by far.

<p>Twenty-five years back, general and business interactions were mainly synchronous. To achieve almost anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when dealing with nationwide and global business.

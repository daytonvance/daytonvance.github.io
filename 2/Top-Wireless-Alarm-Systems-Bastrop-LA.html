<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative clever home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.

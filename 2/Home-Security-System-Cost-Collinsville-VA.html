<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

(For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

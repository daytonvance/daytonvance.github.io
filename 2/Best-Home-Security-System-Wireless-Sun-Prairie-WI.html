<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>

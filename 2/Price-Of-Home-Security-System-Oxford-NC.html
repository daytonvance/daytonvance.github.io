For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This choice is normally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video in the cloud.

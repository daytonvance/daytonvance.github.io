<h3>Home Security System Cameras in Florida</h3>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

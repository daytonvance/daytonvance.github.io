<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

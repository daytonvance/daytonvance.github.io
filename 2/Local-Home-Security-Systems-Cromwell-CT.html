<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential wrongdoers are less most likely to commit criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a greater risk of being captured. This is likewise referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the culprit should understand the included surveillance for it to achieve its wanted effect.</p>
<p>An expertly monitored system is seen by an alarm company from a monitoring center. The company contacts the property owner and the authorities if there's a problem. Authorities aren't called if the homeowner verifies there isn't an emergency situation. If the homeowner can't be reached, the company accesses the situation and can call the cops if needed. House owners spend for a security system to be professionally monitored. There's a monthly monitoring fee that usually varies between $15-40 a month.</p>

Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.

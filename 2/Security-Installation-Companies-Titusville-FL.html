<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

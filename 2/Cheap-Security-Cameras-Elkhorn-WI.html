Tenants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive.

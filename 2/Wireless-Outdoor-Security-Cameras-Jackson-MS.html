These sensing units help you secure your home from things like floods and freezing temperature levels. Smart sensors take details from the physical environments to identify changes in the environment that could indicate trouble.

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, typically through 110VAC power.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

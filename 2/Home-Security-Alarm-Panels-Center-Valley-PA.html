<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial.

Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

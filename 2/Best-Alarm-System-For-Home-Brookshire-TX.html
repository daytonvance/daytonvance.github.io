It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card.

However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

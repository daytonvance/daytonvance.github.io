<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was discovered.

It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.

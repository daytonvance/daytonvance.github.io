<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might measure up to some of our top picks. It likewise includes two days of totally free cloud storage (with a choice for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.

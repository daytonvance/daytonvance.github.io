<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

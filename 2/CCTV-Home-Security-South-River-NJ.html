<p>Possible burglars by and large choose easier targets with the least amount of danger involved. House owners likewise often install phony security cameras using the exact same thinking.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

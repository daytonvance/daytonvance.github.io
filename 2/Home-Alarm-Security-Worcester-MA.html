<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is a fantastic alternative for a cheap home security system with clever home support. But perhaps avoid the cameras for now. Disk drive storage is safe, secure, and hassle-free, with many systems providing expansion and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually remove to transfer the information?

For instance, you can have a clever plug turn on a light inside your home or trigger an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>

The equipment's all provided by 3rd parties, so what you get might be from a various manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier design involving third-party dealerships. The dealers determine which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ. Bigger systems that use full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective option.</p>

<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level cops official in Washington, DC was captured utilizing cops databases to collect information on customers of a gay club. By searching for the license plate varieties of cars parked at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed. Imagine what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it gives off.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

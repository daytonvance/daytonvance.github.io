<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.

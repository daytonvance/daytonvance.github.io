<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>

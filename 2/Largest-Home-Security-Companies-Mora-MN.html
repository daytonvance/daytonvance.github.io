Some want to broaden the video they collect through their own surveillance cameras by also using video footage taken by private people and companies.</p>

The camera can tape video in up to 1080p, which looks completely great on a smartphone screen and won't tax your internet connection too much. Netatmo likewise allows you to fine tune the settings for each specific user - for example, don't tape-record Abbie, but do record Ben. It's actually pretty wise.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

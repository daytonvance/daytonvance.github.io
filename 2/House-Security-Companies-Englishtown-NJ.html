The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

For someone looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that desires a trained expert to make the recommendation for the setup, specialist installation is a great alternative.

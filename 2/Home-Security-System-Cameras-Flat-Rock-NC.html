<h3>Wireless Security System Flat Rock NC 28731</h3>
<p>There are two main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

<p>Property protection devices are developed to protect specific, tangible assets, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. The sensing unit will activate an alarm if the item to which the device has actually been attached is moved or disrupted. All installed elements, consisting of sensors, are connected to a control panel. Users both activate and shut down the alarm system utilizing this panel, either by using a fob or a numbered code.</p>
<p>The 2nd main difference is the rates. Wired systems can be notoriously pricey. Every element of the system will cost you cash. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

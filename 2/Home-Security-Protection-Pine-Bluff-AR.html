<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We need to again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit. You can automatically make the smart lights turn on to terrify away prospective robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>

Will they be able to see and record video effectively in low-lighting? Are they put with sufficient field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be needed? When selecting security cameras for your CCTV system, these are all crucial concerns to be considered.</p>

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

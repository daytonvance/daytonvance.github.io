The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough.

The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

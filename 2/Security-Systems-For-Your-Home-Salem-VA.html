As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

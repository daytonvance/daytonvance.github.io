<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary smart device app that allows citizens who see something suspicious to take a photo and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider might notice someone behaving suspiciously. Lots of people are messing, surfing or texting with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a picture of the suspicious activity and send it to security authorities with a couple of clicks. Reports from smart phone users can be rapidly reviewed and acted upon by Public Safety officials.</p>
<p>In the evening, though it does not have the complete IR LED variety of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're placing it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the great motion detection. Not just is the Arlo quick to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security market was dominated by a few big names using pricey, stiff strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term contracts. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>

Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or much better.

The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>

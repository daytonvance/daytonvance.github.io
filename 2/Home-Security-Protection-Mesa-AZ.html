<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>For wise home features, we suggest the ADT Pulse plan. It provides full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you remotely arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and control the thermostat so you never have to come home to a chilly house. ADT also deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful people with mobile phones is better security than one security person viewing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>

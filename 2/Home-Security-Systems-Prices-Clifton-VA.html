During testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when motion was identified.

For a lot of homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers.

A self-monitored home limits the capacity for subsequent charges and incorrect alarms.</p>

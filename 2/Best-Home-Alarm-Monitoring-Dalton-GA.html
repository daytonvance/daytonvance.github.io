<p>Entrances and exits - Security cameras placed at the exits and entrances to your business will track not only who enters your business, but for how long they stay. The precise positioning near the entryway and exit is key too. Attempt to install the camera near a sign or other eye-catching feature where most people will look as they exit the building or enter.

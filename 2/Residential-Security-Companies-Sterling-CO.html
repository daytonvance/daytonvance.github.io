<p>Analog cameras are the pioneers of the surveillance industry and are an inexpensive, low-resolution security option. While simple and very budget-friendly to establish, analog cameras will likely be phased out as newer, much better technology is developed. Once an alarm is activated, most house owners who decide for self-monitoring rely on a home security system that's specifically created to send out instant signals to their smartphone.

<p>Ring is one of the most significant names in the plugged-in home security video game, and the Ring Indoor Cam is developed to couple with the company's Ring - Always Home app, along with,'s Turner mentions, video doorbells. You can even match numerous cameras together on the app, if you so desire. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some extra cash while giving a client change, for example), we believe it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you require.

<p>A system that requires a contract might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

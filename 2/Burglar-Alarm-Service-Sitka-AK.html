<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

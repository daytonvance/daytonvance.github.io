<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

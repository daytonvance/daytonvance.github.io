<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

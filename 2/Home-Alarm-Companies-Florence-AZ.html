<p>Home security systems and contemporary clever home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety as much as 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for taped video.

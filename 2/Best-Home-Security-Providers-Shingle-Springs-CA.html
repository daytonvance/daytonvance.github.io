<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, generally prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new elements too.

<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make customers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>Buying equipment is simpler with SimpliSafe than with ADT monitoring through SafeStreets. With SimpliSafe, you can buy everything online without making telephone call or having a back-and-forth. ADT doesn't have that alternative. You have to talk with a representative and get a quote. Then, throughout installation, the service individual might also make recommendations. Basically, you may not understand precisely what you're investing until after everything's installed, which makes it difficult to budget for.</p>

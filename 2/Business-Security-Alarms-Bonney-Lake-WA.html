The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, typically an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the main station where screens obtain the images through proprietary software application.

<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of formal surveillance," implying that not only does CCTV have the capability to take the place of authorities or gatekeeper however CCTV can also enhance officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

Those are different options with different requirements and objectives.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

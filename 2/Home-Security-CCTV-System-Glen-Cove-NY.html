<p>Unless cut or otherwise harmed, hardwired security systems remain linked no matter what, since wires are linked to sensors that do not require batteries to operate, removing the possibility that a wired system could fail due to an ill-timed battery outage.

Digital video makers claim that turning CCTV setups into digital video setups is inherently much better).</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply.

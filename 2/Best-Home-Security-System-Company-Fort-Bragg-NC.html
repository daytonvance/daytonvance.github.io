<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night.

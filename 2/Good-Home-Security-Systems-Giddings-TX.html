<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

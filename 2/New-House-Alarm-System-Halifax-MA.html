<p>Alarm systems have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in personal homes as well. A wireless security camera might require a cable connection for power, but might utilize Wi-Fi for saving video. One advantage of a wireless security camera is its ease of installation. You won't need to drill holes to run cables, but you may need to up the camera better to a power outlet. A wireless security camera is also a much better choice for occupants and those who might move more regularly because of the light setup.

<p>What many individuals do not realize is that there is another class of security camera that is straight offered to the general public, though not found in the big box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these big box chains to secure their inventory. Take a look at the ceiling of consumer electronic devices stores and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the average customer camera.

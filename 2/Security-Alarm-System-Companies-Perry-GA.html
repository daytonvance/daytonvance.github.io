<p>As previously pointed out, the affordable video surveillance options, like any electronic device, have longevity in climate-controlled environments and milder climates. It's when set up outdoors in harsher environments that they fail to carry out regularly. Professional video surveillance cameras, whether analog or digital, deal ruggedized outdoor enclosures or real estates particularly developed to protect the camera from the elements and the images created by those cameras. These real estates consist of heating systems, not just to keep the equipment warm in subzero temperature levels, but also to prevent the dome or window from fogging up in damp and cool weather.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, but the black and white version can in fact be clearer and give you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- but for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar energy with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

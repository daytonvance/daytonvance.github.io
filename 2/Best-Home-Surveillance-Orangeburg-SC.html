<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

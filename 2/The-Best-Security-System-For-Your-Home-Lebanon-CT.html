<p>Conserving uncompressed digital recordings takes up an enormous amount of hard drive space, and a few hours of uncompressed video might quickly fill up a hard disk. Holiday uncompressed recordings might look fine however one might not run uncompressed quality recordings on a constant basis.

<p>You'll have to buy a Nest Aware subscription in order to save video footage. You can pick between rolling five, 10, and 30-day storage options, but you can't pick one rate to cover all cameras. Nest Aware subscriptions are priced per camera, and if you want to opt out of paying for storage altogether, Nest only provides you as much as three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are connected by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, use a WiFi connection, are quick to establish, and can be put anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>

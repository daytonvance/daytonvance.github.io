<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Increasing release of voice over IP innovation (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of sites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.

<p>Professional installation was practically the only way to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Innovation has come such a long way that DIY systems can provide the exact same level of security (and frequently more) with a self installed system. Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a DIY system due to the fact that they're normally a lot easier to move to another home if you move. For somebody looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that wants a trained expert to make the recommendation for the setup, expert installation is a terrific choice.

There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially valuable in this phase.</p>

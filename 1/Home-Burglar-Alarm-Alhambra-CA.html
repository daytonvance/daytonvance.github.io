<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

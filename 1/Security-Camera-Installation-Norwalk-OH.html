<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common type of 2 piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or generally closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>

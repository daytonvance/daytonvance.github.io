<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses appointed to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more competence to setup, and usually cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units interact with a control panel.

<p>We also like that Ring still has decent wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with smart home gadgets like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your total security system. With the advances in innovation, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.

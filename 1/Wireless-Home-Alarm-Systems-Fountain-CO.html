<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops response to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

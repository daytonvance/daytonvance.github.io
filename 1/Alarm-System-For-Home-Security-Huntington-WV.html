Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>This nifty wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was spotted.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational crime prevention developed to prevent both personal and property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

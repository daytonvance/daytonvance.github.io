<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey incorrect alarms.

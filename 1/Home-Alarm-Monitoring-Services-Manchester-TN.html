As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

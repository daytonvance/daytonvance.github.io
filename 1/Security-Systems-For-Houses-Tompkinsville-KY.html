<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensors and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, placement is more versatile. Contact sensing units are the first thing you need to buy along with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will signal you when they open.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>

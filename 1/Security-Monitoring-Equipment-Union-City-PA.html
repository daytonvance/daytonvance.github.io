Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensors. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This indicates that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, especially if your residential or commercial property is bigger than 4,500 square feet.</p>
<p>IP (Internet protocol) cameras perform the same functions as their analog counterparts, however with greatly greater abilities.

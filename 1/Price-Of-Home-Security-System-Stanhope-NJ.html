Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of up to one year of battery life.

Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets shout, felines scream, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and proficiency. I'm unsure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera performs all that well when it's foggy or raining, specifically in the evening when weather conditions really tinker the night vision.

You can select in between rolling 5, ten, and 30-day storage choices, however you can't choose one rate to cover all cameras. Nest Aware memberships are priced per camera, and if you want to pull out of paying for storage altogether, Nest only provides you as much as three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are connected by hard-wired cable televisions and need access to power outlets, making them harder to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, use a WiFi connection, are quick to set up, and can be placed anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
<p>Every city has its own guidelines for home security systems. Some cities will require that those buying a home security system pay and use for an authorization to have it installed.

<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it allows you to control practically every element of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable. Inside the app, you can even control e-mail subscriptions, SMS notifies, or the in-app alerts.</p>
<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Lots of full-time" homeowners with alarm systems tell us that they are home all the time" and wonder why they would need monitoring. Nevertheless, individuals need to take into account the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - instead of simply their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will react and hear to the alarm? Etc. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the client anticipates is being provided.</p>

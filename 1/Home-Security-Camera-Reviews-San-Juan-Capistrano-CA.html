(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that a lot of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some additional money while giving a consumer modification, for instance), we believe it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you require.

Like any intrusive innovation, the advantages of deploying public video cameras must be stabilized against the expenses and threats. This technology (a) has the prospective modification the core experience of going out in public in America due to the fact that of its chilling effect on citizens, (b) carries really real dangers of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not significantly protect us versus terrorism. Given that, its advantages - avoiding at the majority of a couple of street crimes, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>

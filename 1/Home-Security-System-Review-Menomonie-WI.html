<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should offer a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).

However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.

A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>

This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more versatile.

Fair warning: You'll probably have to tweak the sound sensitivity settings to prevent informs from barking dogs, loud automobiles, and other random sounds.</p>

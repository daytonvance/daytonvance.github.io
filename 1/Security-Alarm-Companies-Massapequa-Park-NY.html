<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative clever home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Renters, unlike house owners, typically prevent making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can quickly be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too.

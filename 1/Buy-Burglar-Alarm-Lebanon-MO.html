<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they might be watched at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals might find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

Occupants, unlike property owners, usually avoid making irreversible changes to their homes.

In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various homes later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

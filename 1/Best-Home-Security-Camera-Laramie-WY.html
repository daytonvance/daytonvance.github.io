<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

Look at the ceiling of consumer electronic devices stores and warehouse chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the average consumer camera.

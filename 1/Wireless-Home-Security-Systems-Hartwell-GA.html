<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Fantastic clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 annually) for one month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 each month for person detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage as much as 31 days.</p>

On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

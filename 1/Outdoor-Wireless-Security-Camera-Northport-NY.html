<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed homes) a costly and inefficient  technique to robbery decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has acquired rather the excitement for many years. We've been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security package that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Administrative hearing fines originate from violations of structure, fire and sanitary codes, as well as city tickets for such infractions as incorrect burglar alarms.

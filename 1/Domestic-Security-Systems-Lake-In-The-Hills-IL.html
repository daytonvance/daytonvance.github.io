<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours). Nevertheless, wise alarms do need a hub that enables the various parts to wirelessly link. However for many clever alarms this hub can be placed throughout your home.</p>
<p>Wireless sensors that link to your system control panel make installation less intrusive.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
<p>For the many part, I think that Philips Color's outdoor lights are overpriced and actually only worth it if you want to splurge That said, I actually liked the Philips Hue Outdoor Sensor, which you can get for less than $50. Stick it up anywhere you like outside, and it'll track motion, temperature and ambient light conditions. You can utilize that info to activate your Shade lights, and likewise to trigger any Apple HomeKit devices under your roof.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. If a client is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is usually open or typically closed.

Flood lights can prevent vandals or terrify them away, but as a single tool, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>

<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video footage given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Keep an eye on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or screen and Chromecast or a TELEVISION with Chromecast built-in.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and once again in consumer reviews, and it provides a crisp picture up to 32 feet.

A great deal of wise cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>

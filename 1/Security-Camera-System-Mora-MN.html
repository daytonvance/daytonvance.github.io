Professional home security describes packages that are professionally installed and professionally monitored. DIY stands for do-it-yourself.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

And in reaction to consumer interest and need, we moved Google Nest Secure into our top 5.

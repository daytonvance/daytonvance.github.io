<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

<p>Some home insurance companies require you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. Nevertheless, alarms needed by insurance provider need to comply with the European Requirement EN 50131 and needs to be set up by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer.

Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

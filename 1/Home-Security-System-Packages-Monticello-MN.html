Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Some individuals might say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they attack privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you.

<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of formal surveillance," implying that not only does CCTV have the ability to take the place of police or security officers but CCTV can likewise enhance officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

On a bigger scale, using CCTV also presents the possibility of helping in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a crime might assist in examinations and prosecutions (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

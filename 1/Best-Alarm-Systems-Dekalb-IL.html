<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

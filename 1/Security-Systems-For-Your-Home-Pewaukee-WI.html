<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

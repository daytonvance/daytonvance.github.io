Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

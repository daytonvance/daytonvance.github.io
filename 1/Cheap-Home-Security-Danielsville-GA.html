Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was found. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

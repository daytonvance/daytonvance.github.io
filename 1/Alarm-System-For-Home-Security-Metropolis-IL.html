Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

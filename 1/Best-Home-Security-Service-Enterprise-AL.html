Central station operators might be advised to call emergency situation services right away, or to first call the safeguarded premises or home supervisor to try to determine if the alarm is genuine. Operators might also begin calling a list of contact number offered by the client to call someone to go examine the secured premises.

Siren Numerous one-box systems like Canary and Somfy include a very loud built-in siren that needs to hopefully scare off intruders (or next door's cat).

Both likewise lack individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to reduce false informs.</p>

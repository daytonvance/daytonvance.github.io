<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

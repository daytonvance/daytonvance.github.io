Homeowners can pick from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape-record video when an alarm is activated, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the total system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere.

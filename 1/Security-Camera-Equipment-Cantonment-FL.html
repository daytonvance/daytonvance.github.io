You will not get a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by applicable law, return an amount equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without limitation, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, changed or not returned).</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

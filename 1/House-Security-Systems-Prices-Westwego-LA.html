<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost.

However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey approach to burglary reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and pricey approach to burglary reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>

In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

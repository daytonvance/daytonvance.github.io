<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You must play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, dogs shout, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>

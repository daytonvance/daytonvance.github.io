<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

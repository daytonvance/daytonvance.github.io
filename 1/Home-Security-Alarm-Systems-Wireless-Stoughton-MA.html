As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

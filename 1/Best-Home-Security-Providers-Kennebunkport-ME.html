<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

The alarm system is just one of two we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're pleased that it also includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further preventing anybody from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property. We tested Somfy's more pricey system, which included a wifi security camera, but more economical kits are also offered. Despite the significant cost here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>

Most alarm companies would rather provide and install their own equipment instead of go through this inconvenience.

Concealing a camera within a frame, clock, sprinkler head, or smoke alarm could make a reception security camera more effective, however make sure to check with state laws relating to the legality of a concealed camera before doing so.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.

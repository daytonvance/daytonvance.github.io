<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

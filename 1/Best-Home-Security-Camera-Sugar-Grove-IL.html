If you wish to keep an eye on what's taking place in your home when you're not there, however you don't want to purchase a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera deserves a look. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Aside from terrific equipment, Frontpoint utilizes 100% wireless equipment using cellular technology.

<p>Reliability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's often manipulated by factors such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger false alarms. While enhancements in recent years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that don't impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Wireless home security is versatile. If you don't like where a sensor or camera is placed, move it. There are no wires stopping you. Add them or take them away quickly if you desire more or less gadgets on your system. You can install the system yourself or hire a professional. The choice is yours. Wired systems need professional installation, and you can't quickly add equipment or move it around. You're connected by wires. Wireless systems use a freedom that wired systems can not.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

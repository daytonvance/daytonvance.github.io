Throughout screening, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was spotted. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>

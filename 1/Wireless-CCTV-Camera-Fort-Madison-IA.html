<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any client in the network that understands the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>
<p>Many modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to browse archived video footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several areas. Often, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more figured out robbers. If burglars can not see any security cameras, they might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>

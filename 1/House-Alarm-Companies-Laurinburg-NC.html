In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.

In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually discovered that they have actually not decreased crime. "When the criminal offense and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the basic down trend in offences and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre."

<p>Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free.

Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

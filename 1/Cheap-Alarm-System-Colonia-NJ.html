Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate instead of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Professionally monitored security systems require a month-to-month monitoring fee that can range from ($ 20 to $60) per month.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

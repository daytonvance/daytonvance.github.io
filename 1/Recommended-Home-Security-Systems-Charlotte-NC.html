<h3>Wireless House Alarm Charlotte NC 28269</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their newest line of equipment. Both systems provide impressive, trustworthy home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, however that greater price includes a system that is smaller sized, faster, and more powerful. At half the size of the initial system, the tiny sensing units are virtually invisible. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten trespassers.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Wireless Security Alarm System Lincolnton GA 30817</h3>
<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables somebody to find what they are looking for without having to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the taped video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful service for catching wrongdoers and collecting proof.</p>

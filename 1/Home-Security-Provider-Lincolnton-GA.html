<h3>Wireless Security Alarm System Lincolnton GA 30817</h3>
<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For beginners, Deep Learning enables somebody to find what they are looking for without having to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the taped video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful service for catching wrongdoers and collecting proof.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply.

Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>

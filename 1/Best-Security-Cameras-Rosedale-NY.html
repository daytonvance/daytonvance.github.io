<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the fact, which implies that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to record the same length of video footage.

Although the cameras evaluated in this guide do have basic security features, they can't change a complete home security system, that includes door and window and motion sensors, smoke alarm, and so on.</p>

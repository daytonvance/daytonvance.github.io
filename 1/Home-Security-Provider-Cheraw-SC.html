Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by.

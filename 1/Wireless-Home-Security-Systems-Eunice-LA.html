It works as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and third party-devices through Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. Another location where Arlo excels is client service. After long-lasting screening this camera considering that we initially made it a pick in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q began predicting a pink tint, which seems to be a continuous problem for some owners.

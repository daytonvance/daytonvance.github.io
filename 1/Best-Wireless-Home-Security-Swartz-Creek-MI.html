SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would alert users when it detected any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the concern. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

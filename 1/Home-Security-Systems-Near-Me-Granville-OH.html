Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and sometimes, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives since their design enables minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection.

There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

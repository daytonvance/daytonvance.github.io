<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

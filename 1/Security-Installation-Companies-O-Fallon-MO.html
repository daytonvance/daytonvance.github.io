The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for keeping an eye on visitors and plan deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your lawn susceptible. This system might not be the best fit if you have a large yard or outbuildings to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

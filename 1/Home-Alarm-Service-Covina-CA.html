<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational crime avoidance designed to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

It's an attractive feature as it can remove the cost of monthly storage costs. The downside (if there isn't a cloud backup) is that if a crook steals your camera, he takes your forensic evidence with it. SimpliSafe customers get contract-free security systems without any cancellation fees. Wi-Fi cameras are excellent for security but likewise far more. The key is picking the design that gets the job done you need done.</p>

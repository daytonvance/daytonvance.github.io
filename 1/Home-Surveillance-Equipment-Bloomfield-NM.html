<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small charge. Due to the fact that it comes with several door and window sensors for complete protection, we recommend the eight-piece set. We likewise suggest adding a doorbell camera eventually.

The first guard got here early so he might look at the whole area and talk with me about my issues. He was expert, polite and really encouraging. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, comforting and polite. We were extremely happy with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't stress when after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands.</p>

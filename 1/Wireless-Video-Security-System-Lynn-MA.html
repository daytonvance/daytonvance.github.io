<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we've developed great relationships with both local police forces and their customers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be often weak, and vulnerable to exploits. It almost does not matter how strong your password is or if your software is up to date if cybercriminals can simply hijack your Wi-Fi data.

You can visit and do everything you require. Much better still, you no longer need to fret about having an IT professional on staff to handle the hardware or handle changing it every 3-5 years.</p>
<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>

Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>

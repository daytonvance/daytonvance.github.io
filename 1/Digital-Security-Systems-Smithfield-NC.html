<p>Unlike wired security systems that go through your phone lines and can need more extensive installation, wireless systems can be installed in a matter of minutes as a pain-free and quick DIY task. Convenience is the significant reason individuals switch to wireless," says Du, and it's tough to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired choice requires expert installation of wires below your house.

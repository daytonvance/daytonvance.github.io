<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

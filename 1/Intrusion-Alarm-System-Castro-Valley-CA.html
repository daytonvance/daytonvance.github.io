For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or register for a security element as a part of a "smart home" plan; these innovations depend on user passwords to arm and deactivate them. To keep these devices secure, it's suggested that consumers routinely alter their passwords and never share them with people outside the household.

Set a temporary password and reset it as quickly as you return if you go on vacation and have someone coming over to examine or feed family pets on your home.

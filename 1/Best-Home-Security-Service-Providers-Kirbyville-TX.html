<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the truth, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

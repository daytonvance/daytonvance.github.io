<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

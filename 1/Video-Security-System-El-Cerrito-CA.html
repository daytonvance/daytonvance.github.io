<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you intend to store and for how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.

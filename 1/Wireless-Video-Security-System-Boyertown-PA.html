<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when movement was discovered.

For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive.
